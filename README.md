Alpha Waves is a React Native/TypeScript application available for both iOS and Android. The app specializes in delivering alpha wave frequencies with swipe-able video/audio playback. The design allows users to engage with a timer control and an ExoPlayer native module.

Alpha waves, within the range of 8 to 12 Hz, are generated by the brain during moments of relaxation and meditation. A deficiency in these waves indicates that we might not be in our most relaxed state. Engaging in activities that promote alpha waves, such as meditation, can foster creativity, reduce stress, and invoke a sense of calm. The app further enhances the experience by offering a built-in timer to regulate the duration of alpha wave sounds. Users can also toggle video playback using the 'video' button, tailoring the experience to their preference.
